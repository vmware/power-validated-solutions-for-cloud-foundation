## Overview

`PowerValidatedSolutions` is a PowerShell module that has been written to support the automation of many procedures associated with the implementation of the [VMware Validated Solutions][vvs] for [VMware Cloud Foundation][docs-vmware-cloud-foundation].

The module helps reduce human error, delivers consistency and robustness, and accelerates the time-to-deploy these solutions. The module's cmdlets reduce complexity by automating the deployment and configuration steps using the product APIs or command-line tools.

This infrastructure-as-code model enables you to use the module to accelerate the deployment and management of the VMware Validate Solutions or use it in your own end-to-end automation.
